# Caesar Cipher Program


## Overview

The Caesar Cipher Program is a simple command-line application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm. The program prompts the user for a message and a shift value, then performs the desired operation (encryption or decryption) and displays the result.

## Features

Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Non-alphabetic characters are preserved in the output.
User-friendly command-line interface.


## Requirements
Python 3.x

## How to Use the Program:

Run the program.
Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message by entering 'E' or 'D'.
Input the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter the shift value (a positive integer).
The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.
You can choose to perform another operation or exit the program.
